Documentation
=================
Documentation can be generated with [ApiGen](http://apigen.org). You may have to 
modify the `apigen.neon` file to suit your particular installation, but it should
work. Documentation will be output here.

Also, if you run `phpunit`, code coverage will be output in this folder as well.
Just open `doc/coverage/index.html` after running `phpunit`.
